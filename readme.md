# Play with genetic algorithms

- **Example 1**: Repeat the example by Kie Codes (see references)
- **Example 2**: Try to get multilinear regression weights by genetic algorithms

## Requirements

- Windows 10
- Visual Code Studio
- Anaconda

The virtual enviroment uses Python 3.8.8. We don't need an Anaconda Tensorflow Env or all the packages in there, but It's time to think in the future of this code.

## Virtual enviroment

```bash
conda create -n tf tensorflow
conda activate tf
```
